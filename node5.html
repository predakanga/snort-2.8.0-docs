</H1>

<P>
OK, all of these commands are pretty cool, but if you want to record
the packets to the disk, you need to specify a logging directory and
Snort will automatically know to go into packet logger mode:

<P>
<PRE>
./snort -dev -l ./log
</PRE>
Of course, this assumes you have a directory named <code>log</code>
in the current directory. If you don't, Snort will exit with an error
message. When Snort runs in this mode, it collects every packet it
sees and places it in a directory hierarchy based upon the IP address
of one of the hosts in the datagram.

<P>
If you just specify a plain -l switch, you may
notice that Snort sometimes uses the address of the remote computer
as the directory in which it places packets and sometimes it uses
the local host address. In order to log relative to the home network,
you need to tell Snort which network is the home network:

<P>
<PRE>
./snort -dev -l ./log -h 192.168.1.0/24
</PRE>
This rule tells Snort that you want to print out the data link and
TCP/IP headers as well as application data into the directory <code>./log</code>,
and you want to log the packets relative to the 192.168.1.0 class
C network. All incoming packets will be recorded into subdirectories
of the log directory, with the directory names being based on the
address of the remote (non-192.168.1) host. 

<P>

        
        <p><table border="1"><tr><td><b>
        Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
Note that if both the source and destination hosts are on the home 
network, they are logged to a directory with a name based on the higher 
of the two port numbers or, in the case of a tie, the source address.
        
        </b></td></tr></table></p>

<P>
If you're on a high speed network or you want to log the packets into
a more compact form for later analysis, you should consider logging
in binary mode. Binary mode logs the packets in
tcpdump format to a single binary file in the
logging directory:

<P>
<PRE>
./snort -l ./log -b
</PRE>
Note the command line changes here. We don't need to specify a home
network any longer because binary mode logs everything into a single
file, which eliminates the need to tell it how to format the output
directory structure. Additionally, you don't need to run in verbose
mode or specify the -d or -e switches because in binary mode the entire
packet is logged, not just sections of it. All you really need to do
to place Snort into logger mode is to specify a logging
directory at the command line using the -l switch&mdash;the -b binary logging
switch merely provides a modifier that tells Snort to log the packets in
something other than the default output format of plain ASCII text.

<P>
Once the packets have been logged to the binary file, you can read
the packets back out of the file with any sniffer that supports the
tcpdump binary format (such as tcpdump or Ethereal). Snort can also
read the packets back by using the -r switch, which puts it into playback
mode. Packets from any tcpdump formatted file can be processed through
Snort in any of its run modes. For example, if you wanted to run a
binary log file through Snort in sniffer mode to dump the packets
to the screen, you can try something like this:

<P>
<PRE>
./snort -dv -r packet.log
</PRE>
You can manipulate the data in the file in a number of ways through
Snort's packet logging and intrusion detection modes, as well as with
the BPF interface that's available from the command line. For example,
if you only wanted to see the ICMP packets from the log file, simply
specify a BPF filter at the command line and Snort will only see
the ICMP packets in the file:

<P>
<PRE>
./snort -dvr packet.log icmp
</PRE>
For more info on how to use the BPF interface, read the Snort and
tcpdump man pages.
