<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Rule Actions 
</H2>

<P>
The rule header contains the information that defines the who,
where, and what of a packet, as well as what to do in the
event that a packet with all the attributes indicated in the rule
should show up. The first item in a rule is the rule action. The rule
action tells Snort what to do when it finds a packet that matches
the rule criteria. There are 5 available default actions in Snort,
alert, log, pass, activate, and dynamic. In addition, if you are running
Snort in inline mode, you have additional options which include drop, reject, and sdrop. 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>alert - generate an alert using the selected alert method, and then
log the packet 
</LI>
<LI>log - log the packet 
</LI>
<LI>pass - ignore the packet 
</LI>
<LI>activate - alert and then turn on another dynamic rule  
</LI>
<LI>dynamic - remain idle until activated by an activate rule , then act
as a log rule
</LI>
<LI>drop - make iptables drop the packet and log the packet
</LI>
<LI>reject - make iptables drop the packet, log it, and then send a 
TCP reset if the protocol is TCP or an ICMP port unreachable message if the 
protocol is UDP.
</LI>
<LI>sdrop - make iptables drop the packet but does not log it.
</LI>
</OL>
You can also define your own rule types and associate one or more
output plugins with them. You can then use the rule types as actions
in Snort rules.

<P>
This example will create a type that will log to just tcpdump:

<P>
<PRE>
ruletype suspicious
{
    type log 
    output log_tcpdump: suspicious.log
}
</PRE>

<P>
This example will create a rule type that will log to syslog and a
MySQL database:

<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
</DIV><PRE>
ruletype redalert
{
      type alert 
      output alert_syslog: LOG_AUTH LOG_ALERT 
      output database: log, mysql, user=snort dbname=snort host=localhost 
}
</PRE>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Protocols</A>
</H2>

<P>
The next field in a rule is the protocol. There are four protocols
that Snort currently analyzes for suspicious behavior &ndash; TCP, UDP,
ICMP, and IP. In the future there may be more, such as ARP, IGRP,
GRE, OSPF, RIP, IPX, etc.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00423000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> IP Addresses</A>
</H2>

<P>
The next portion of the rule header deals with the IP address and
port information for a given rule. The keyword any
may be used to define any address. Snort does not have a mechanism
to provide host name lookup for the IP address fields in the rules
file. The addresses are formed by a straight numeric IP address and
a CIDR[<A
 HREF="node38.html#cidrnotation">3</A>] block. The CIDR block indicates the netmask
that should be applied to the rule's address and any incoming packets
that are tested against the rule. A CIDR block mask of /24 indicates
a Class C network, /16 a Class B network, and /32 indicates a specific
machine address. For example, the address/CIDR combination 192.168.1.0/24
would signify the block of addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255.
Any rule that used this designation for, say, the destination address
would match on any address in that range. The CIDR designations give
us a nice short-hand way to designate large address spaces with just
a few characters.

<P>
In Figure <A HREF="node17.html#Sample_Snort_Rule"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>, the source IP address was set
to match for any computer talking, and the destination address was
set to match on the 192.168.1.0 Class C network.

<P>
There is an operator that can be applied to IP addresses, the negation
operator. This operator tells Snort to match any IP address except
the one indicated by the listed IP address. The negation operator
is indicated with a !. For example, an easy modification
to the initial example is to make it alert on any traffic that originates
outside of the local net with the negation operator as shown in Figure
<A HREF="#Example_Negation"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

<P>
This rule's IP addresses indicate any tcp packet with a
source IP address not originating from the internal network and a
destination address on the internal network.

<P>
You may also specify lists of IP addresses. An IP list is specified
by enclosing a comma separated list of IP addresses and CIDR blocks
within square brackets. For the time being, the IP list may not include
spaces between the addresses. See Figure <A HREF="#IP_list_usage"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for
an example of an IP list in action.

<P>
Port numbers may be specified in a number of ways, including any
ports, static port definitions, ranges, and by negation. Any
ports are a wildcard value, meaning literally any port. Static ports
are indicated by a single port number, such as 111 for portmapper,
23 for telnet, or 80 for http, etc. Port ranges are indicated with
the range operator :. The range operator may be
applied in a number of ways to take on different meanings, such as
in Figure <A HREF="#port_range_examples"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

<P>
Port negation is indicated by using the negation operator !.
The negation operator may be applied against any of the other rule
types (except any, which would translate to none, how Zen...). For
example, if for some twisted reason you wanted to log everything except
the X Windows ports, you could do something like the rule in Figure
<A HREF="#example_port_negation"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> The Direction Operator</A>
</H2>

<P>
The direction operator -<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.21ex; " SRC="img2.svg"
 ALT="$&gt;$"></SPAN> indicates the orientation,
or direction, of the traffic that the rule applies
to. The IP address and port numbers on the left side of the direction
operator is considered to be the traffic coming from the source host,
and the address and port information on the right side of the operator
is the destination host. There is also a bidirectional operator, which
is indicated with a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.21ex; " SRC="img17.svg"
 ALT="$&lt;&gt;$"></SPAN> symbol. This tells Snort
to consider the address/port pairs in either the source or destination
orientation. This is handy for recording/analyzing both sides of a
conversation, such as telnet or POP3 sessions. An example of the bidirectional
operator being used to record both sides of a telnet session is shown
in Figure <A HREF="#bidirectional_operator"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

<P>
Also, note that there is no <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.21ex; " SRC="img1.svg"
 ALT="$&lt;$"></SPAN>- operator. In Snort
versions before 1.8.7, the direction operator did not have proper
error checking and many people used an invalid token. The reason the
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.80ex; vertical-align: -0.21ex; " SRC="img1.svg"
 ALT="$&lt;$"></SPAN>- does not exist is so that rules always read
consistently.

        </b></td></tr></table></p>

<P>
Activate/dynamic rule pairs give Snort a powerful capability. You
can now have one rule activate another when it's action is performed
for a set number of packets. This is very useful if you want to set
Snort up to perform follow on recording when a specific rule goes
off. Activate rules act just like alert rules, except they
have a *required* option field: activates.
Dynamic rules act just like log rules, but they have a different option
field: activated_by. Dynamic rules have a second
required field as well, count. 

<P>
Activate rules are just like alerts but also tell Snort to add a rule
when a specific network event occurs. Dynamic rules are just like
log rules except are dynamically enabled when the activate rule id
goes off. 

<P>
Put 'em together and they look like Figure <A HREF="#activate_dynamic_rule_example"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

\par\end{figure}"></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
These rules tell Snort to alert when it detects an IMAP buffer overflow
and collect the next 50 packets headed for port 143 coming from outside
$HOME_NET headed to $HOME_NET. If the buffer overflow happened
and was successful, there's a very good possibility that useful data
will be contained within the next 50 (or whatever) packets going to
that same service port on the network, so there's value in collecting
those packets for later analysis.
