<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Network Intrusion Detection System Mode</A>
</H1>

<P>
To enable Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) mode so that you don't
record every single packet sent down the wire, try this:

<P>
<PRE>
./snort -dev -l ./log -h 192.168.1.0/24 -c snort.conf
</PRE>
where <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">snort.conf</SPAN> is the name of your rules file. This will apply the
rules configured in the <code>snort.conf</code> file to each packet to decide if an action
based upon the rule type in the file should be taken. If you don't
specify an output directory for the program, it will default to <code>/var/log/snort</code>.

<P>
One thing to note about the last command line is that if Snort is
going to be used in a long term way as an IDS, the -v
switch should be left off the command line for the sake of speed.
The screen is a slow place to write data to, and packets can be dropped
while writing to the display.

<P>
It's also not necessary to record the data link headers for most applications,
so you can usually omit the -e switch, too.

<P>
<PRE>
./snort -d -h 192.168.1.0/24 -l ./log -c snort.conf
</PRE>
This will configure Snort to run in its most basic NIDS form, logging
packets that trigger rules specified in the <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">snort.conf</SPAN> in plain ASCII 
to disk using a hierarchical directory structure (just like packet logger mode). 

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00241000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> NIDS Mode Output Options</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are a number of ways to configure the output of Snort in NIDS
mode. The default logging and alerting mechanisms are to log in decoded
ASCII format and use full alerts. The full alert
mechanism prints out the alert message in addition to the full packet
headers. There are several other alert output modes available at the
command line, as well as two logging facilities.

<P>
Alert modes are somewhat more complex. There are seven alert modes available
at the command line: full, fast, socket, syslog, console, cmg, and
none. Six of these modes are accessed with the -A command line switch.
These options are:

<P>
Packets can be logged to their default decoded ASCII format or to
a binary log file via the -b command line switch. To disable
packet logging altogether, use the -N command line switch.

<P>
For output modes available through the configuration file, see Section
<A HREF="node14.html#output_config"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

<P>

        
        <p><table border="1"><tr><td><b>
        Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
Command line logging options override any output options specified 
in the configuration file. This allows debugging of configuration 
issues quickly via the command line.
        
        </b></td></tr></table></p>

<P>
To send alerts to syslog, use the -s switch. The default facilities
for the syslog alerting mechanism are LOG_AUTHPRIV and LOG_ALERT.
If you want to configure other facilities for syslog output, use the
output plugin directives in the rules files. See Section <A HREF="node14.html#alert_syslog_lable"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>
for more details on configuring syslog output.

<P>
For example, use the following command line to log to default (decoded ASCII) facility and send alerts to syslog: 

<P>
<PRE>
./snort -c snort.conf -l ./log -h 192.168.1.0/24 -s
</PRE>

<P>
As another example, use the following command line to log to the default facility in /var/log/snort and send alerts to a
fast alert file: 

<P>
<PRE>
./snort -c snort.conf -A fast -h 192.168.1.0/24
</PRE>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Understanding Standard Alert Output</A>
</H2>

<P>
When Snort generates an alert message, it will usually look like the following:

<P>
<PRE>	 
  [**] [116:56:1] (snort_decoder): T/TCP Detected [**]
</PRE>

<P>
The first number is the Generator ID, this tells the user what
  component of Snort generated this alert. For a list of GIDs, please read
  etc/generators in the Snort source. In this case, we know that this event
  came from the &ldquo;decode&rdquo; (116) component of Snort.

<P>
The second number is the Snort ID (sometimes referred to as
  Signature ID). For a list of preprocessor SIDs, please see
  etc/gen-msg.map.  Rule-based SIDs are written directly into the rules
  with the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sid</SPAN> option. In this case, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">56</SPAN> represents a T/TCP event.

<P>
The third number is the revision ID. This number is primarily
  used when writing signatures, as each rendition of the rule should
  increment this number with the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">rev</SPAN> option.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00243000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> High Performance Configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you want Snort to go <SPAN  CLASS="textit">fast</SPAN> (like keep up with a 1000 Mbps connection),
you need to use unified logging and a unified log reader such as
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">barnyard</SPAN>.  This allows Snort to log alerts in a binary form as fast as
possible while another program performs the slow actions, such as writing to a
database.

<P>
If you want a text file that's easily parsable, but still somewhat fast, try
using binary logging with the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; output mechanism. 

<P>
This will log packets in tcpdump format and produce minimal alerts. For
example:

<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
</DIV><PRE>
./snort -b -A fast -c snort.conf
</PRE>
<DIV class="CENTER">
</DIV>

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION00244000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Changing Alert Order</A>
</H2>

<P>
The default way in which Snort applies its rules to packets may not be
appropriate for all installations.  The Alert rules are applied first, then the
Pass rules, and finally, Log rules are applied. This sequence is somewhat
counterintuitive, but it's a more foolproof method than allowing a user to
write a hundred alert rules that are then disabled by an errant pass rule.  For
more information on rule types, see Section <A HREF="node18.html#rules_action_section"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.

<P>
If you know what you're doing, you can use the -o switch to change the default
rule application behavior to apply Pass rules, then Alert rules, then Log
rules:
<DIV class="CENTER">
</DIV><PRE>
./snort -d -h 192.168.1.0/24 -l ./log -c snort.conf -o
</PRE>
<DIV class="CENTER">
</DIV>

<P>
As of Snort 2.6.0, the command line flags <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;alert-before-pass</SPAN>
and <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;treat-drop-as-alert</SPAN> were added to handle changes to rule
ordering and fix an issue when pass and drop rules were not always
enforced.  The <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;alert-before-pass</SPAN> option forces alert rules
to take affect in favor of a pass rule.  The <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;treat-drop-as-alert</SPAN>
causes drop, sdrop, and reject rules and any associated alerts to be logged
as alerts, rather then the normal action.  This allows use of an inline
policy with passive/IDS mode.

<P>
Additionally, the <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;process-all-events</SPAN> option causes Snort to
process every event associated with a packet, while taking the actions
based on the rules ordering.  Without this option (default case), only
the events for the first action based on rules ordering are processed.

<P>

        
        <p><table border="1"><tr><td><b>
        Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
Pass rules are special cases here, in that the event processing is
terminated when a pass rule is encountered, regardless of the use of
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt">&ndash;process-all-events</SPAN>.
        
        </b></td></tr></table></p>

<P>

        
        <p><table border="1"><tr><td><b>
        Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
The additions with Snort 2.6.0 will result in the deprecation of the
-o switch in a future release.
        
        </b></td></tr></table></p>
